<h6 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF.</h6><p class="speech"> Yes, ten years have made me another man. And why? Because I am
overworked. Nurse, I am on my feet from dawn till dusk. I know no rest;
at night I tremble under my blankets for fear of being dragged out to
visit some one who is sick; I have toiled without repose or a day's
freedom since I have known you; could I help growing old? And then,
existence is tedious, anyway; it is a senseless, dirty business, this
life, and goes heavily. Every one about here is silly, and after
living with them for two or three years one grows silly oneself. It is
inevitable.</p><p class="direction"> [Twisting his moustache]</p><p class="speech"> See what a long moustache I have
grown. A foolish, long moustache. Yes, I am as silly as the rest, nurse,
but not as stupid; no, I have not grown stupid. Thank God, my brain is
not addled yet, though my feelings have grown numb. I ask nothing, I
need nothing, I love no one, unless it is yourself alone. [He kisses her
head] I had a nurse just like you when I was a child.</p>

<h6 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h6> <p class="speech"> Don't you want a bite of something to eat?</p>

<h6 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF.</h6> <p class="speech"> No. During the third week of Lent I went to the epidemic at
Malitskoi. It was eruptive typhoid. The peasants were all lying side by
side in their huts, and the calves and pigs were running about the floor
among the sick. Such dirt there was, and smoke! Unspeakable! I slaved
among those people all day, not a crumb passed my lips, but when I got
home there was still no rest for me; a switchman was carried in from the
railroad; I laid him on the operating table and he went and died in
my arms under chloroform, and then my feelings that should have been
deadened awoke again, my conscience tortured me as if I had killed the
man. I sat down and closed my eyes--like this--and thought: will our
descendants two hundred years from now, for whom we are breaking the
road, remember to give us a kind word? No, nurse, they will forget.</p>

<h6 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h6> <p class="speech"> Man is forgetful, but God remembers.</p>

<h6 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF.</h6> <p class="speech"> Thank you for that. You have spoken the truth.</p>

<p>Enter VOITSKI from the house. He has been asleep after dinner and
looks rather dishevelled. He sits down on the bench and straightens his
collar.</p>

<h6 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI.</h6> <p class="speech">H'm. Yes. </p><p class="direction">[A pause]</p> <p class="speech">Yes.</p>

<h6 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF.</h6> <p class="speech"> Have you been asleep?</p>

<h6 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI.</h6> <p class="speech">Yes, very much so.</p><p class="direction">[He yawns]</p> <p class="speech">Ever since the Professor and his
wife have come, our daily life seems to have jumped the track. I sleep
at the wrong time, drink wine, and eat all sorts of messes for luncheon
and dinner. It isn't wholesome. Sonia and I used to work together and
never had an idle moment, but now Sonia works alone and I only eat and
drink and sleep. Something is wrong.</p>

<h6 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h6> <p class="direction">[Shaking her head]</p><p class="speech">Such a confusion in the house! The Professor
gets up at twelve, the samovar is kept boiling all the morning, and
everything has to wait for him. Before they came we used to have dinner
at one o'clock, like everybody else, but now we have it at seven. The
Professor sits up all night writing and reading, and suddenly, at two
o'clock, there goes the bell! Heavens, what is that? The Professor wants
some tea! Wake the servants, light the samovar! Lord, what disorder!</p>

<h6 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF.</h6> <p class="speech"> Will they be here long?</p>

<h6 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI.</h6> <p class="speech"> A hundred years! The Professor has decided to make his home here.</p>
