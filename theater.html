        <h1>Vasanth Sai does Chekov tonight</h1>
        <h3>UNCLE VANYA Anton Chekov</h3>
        <p>A country house on a terrace. In front of it a garden. In an avenue of
            trees, under an old poplar, stands a table set for tea, with a samovar,
            etc. Some benches and chairs stand near the table. On one of them is
            lying a guitar. A hammock is swung near the table. It is three o'clock
            in the afternoon of a cloudy day.<br>
            
            MARINA, a quiet, grey-haired, little old woman, is sitting at the table
            knitting a stocking.<br>
            
            ASTROFF is walking up and down near her.</p>

            <h6 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF.</h6> <p class="direction">[Takes the glass from her unwillingly]</p><p class="speech"> Somehow, I don't seem to
            want any.</p>
            
            <h6 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h6> <p class="speech">Then will you have a little vodka instead?</p>
            
            <h6 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF.</h6> <p class="speech">No, I don't drink vodka every day, and besides, it is too hot
            now. [A pause] Tell me, nurse, how long have we known each other?</p>
            
            <h6 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h6> <p class="direction">[Thoughtfully] </p><p class="speech">Let me see, how long is it? Lord--help me to
            remember. You first came here, into our parts--let me think--when was
            it? Sonia's mother was still alive--it was two winters before she died;
            that was eleven years ago--</p><p class="direction">[thoughtfully]</p><p class="speech"> perhaps more.</p>
            
            <h6 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF.</h6> <p class="speech">Have I changed much since then?</p>

            <h6 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h6> <p class="speech">Oh, yes. You were handsome and young then, and now you are an
            old man and not handsome any more. You drink, too. </p>
